##Features
 * Responsive, Mobile-First Design
 * Easy to learn, Powerful yet Simple
 * Use UI Kit [Customizer](http://www.getuikit.com/docs/customizer.html) to quickly and beautifully transform UI Kit to your own design

##Theme and Plugins
PUIK includes a UI Kit based boilerplate with many features and functions built into an easy to manage config file. There are also many different core plugins for modular functionalities.

Examples:
 * puikManager :: Manages options for UI Kit ex. Navbar, Sidebar, Footer and Content layouts and options
 * puiKSearch :: Adds [UI Kit Search](http://www.getuikit.com/docs/addons_search.html)
 * more to come....

##Ambitions
I have already [started this project](https://github.com/khanduras/pico_uikit) with Pico before I discovered Phile. You can see a demo of what I'd like to accomplish [here](http://puik.khanduras.net).

##Thanks To
This project couldn't be possible if it wasn't for the open-source community of developers

  * [Gilbert Pellegrom](http://gilbert.pellegrom.me/) for developing Pico
  * [Yootheme](http://www.yootheme.com/) for creating [UI Kit](http://getuikit.com)
  * [James Doyle](https://github.com/james2doyle) & Frank NÃ¤gler ([NeoBlack](https://github.com/NeoBlack)) et al for PhileCMS, forked from Pico
  * A [community of plugin developers](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/%5BCOMMUNITY%5D-Plugins) who taught me how to work with Phile and Pico.
