##Getting Started

###Installation
  * Clone this repo
  * Run generator.php and copy into config.php
  * You'll be able to access admin by going to admin/ or clicking the link in the bottom footer

###Admin Panel
Once you get PUIK properly installed, explore the Admin Panel as it will let you add pages and change settings without having to edit a file. 

###puikManager
There are plenty of options found in the config.php file for this plugin.

````php
'page_width' => 'fluid', 					//fluid, full, fixed
'style' => 'flat',							//almost-flat, gradient, flat
'navbar' => 'sticky', 						//off, static, sticky
'sidebar' => 'left', 						//off, left, right
'navbar_layout' => 'main_navbar', 			// {{ theme_dir }}/layout/*.html
'footer_layout' => 'main_footer', 			// {{ theme_dir }}/layout/*.html
'sidebar_layout' => 'main_sidebar', 		// {{ theme_dir }}/layout/*.html
'content_layout' => 'main_content', 		// {{ theme_dir }}/layout/*.html
'customizer' => '', 						// {{ theme_dir }}/*.css

````
These settings can be changed in the following order:
  * puikManager config.php defaults
  * PUIK config.php main configuration override
  * Phile Admin config settings
  * Page Meta

This allows individual pages to have unique settings, but a global setting that can be changed easily.

##Ambitions
I have already [started this project](https://github.com/khanduras/pico_uikit) with Pico before I discovered Phile. You can see a demo of what I'd like to accomplish [here](http://puik.khanduras.net).

##Thanks To
This project couldn't be possible if it wasn't for the open-source community of developers

  * [Gilbert Pellegrom](http://gilbert.pellegrom.me/) for developing Pico
  * [Yootheme](http://www.yootheme.com/) for creating [UI Kit](http://getuikit.com)
  * [James Doyle](https://github.com/james2doyle) & Frank NÃ¤gler ([NeoBlack](https://github.com/NeoBlack)) et al for PhileCMS, forked from Pico
  * A [community of plugin developers](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/%5BCOMMUNITY%5D-Plugins) who taught me how to work with Phile and Pico.
